# Traffic Sign Recognition

Overview
---

This repository contains the solution for project 2 "traffic sign recognition"
for Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree by Marc Neumann.
Traffic sign images are classified using tensorflow with Python and a deep convolutional neuronal network using the LeNet architecture.

Running It
---------------------

**Step 1:** Set up the [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/fbf77062-5703-404e-b60c-95b78b2f3f9e/modules/83ec35ee-1e02-48a5-bdb7-d244bd47c2dc/lessons/8c82408b-a217-4d09-b81d-1bda4c6380ef/concepts/4f1870e0-3849-43e4-b670-12e6f2d4b7a7) if you haven't already.
**Step 2:** Open the code in a Jupyter Notebook
**Step 3:** Run all cells in Jupyter
